# Email Bot with AI Classification - Project Report

## Motivation

Manual email processing for technical inquiries is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Businesses receiving product inquiries often struggle with:

- **Response Time**: Delays in replying to customer emails
- **Consistency**: Varying quality of responses from different team members
- **Document Selection**: Difficulty choosing relevant technical documents for attachments
- **Context Loss**: Missing conversation history in email threads

This project addresses these challenges by creating an intelligent email processing system that automatically classifies incoming emails, generates contextual replies, and selects appropriate technical documents.

## Current Implementation

### Core Features

**Email Classification System**
- Automatically categorizes emails into application types (coastal erosion, road construction, general inquiry)
- Detects customer interest levels (high, medium, surface-level) using keyword analysis
- Flags high-priority emails for human review

**Intelligent Reply Generation**
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for contextual response generation
- Thread-aware replies using conversation history
- Customized responses based on classification results

**Document Management**
- Automated selection of relevant technical documents
- Document library with categorized geotextile specifications
- Smart attachment recommendations based on email content

**Thread Management**
- Conversation history tracking using Gmail thread IDs
- Multiple storage providers (JSON, SQLite, in-memory)
- Configurable history limits and automatic cleanup

### Technical Architecture

**Modular Design**
- Abstracted providers for email, AI, and storage
- Configuration-driven behavior via YAML
- Comprehensive logging and performance monitoring

**Email Processing Pipeline**
1. Fetch unseen emails from Gmail
2. Classify content and detect interest level
3. Generate AI-powered replies with context
4. Select and attach relevant documents
5. Send replies and update thread history

**Configuration Management**
- Environment-based secrets management
- Flexible provider switching for testing
- Comprehensive error handling and retries

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.8+** for core implementation
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for natural language processing
- **Gmail IMAP** for email integration
- **SQLite/JSON** for data persistence
- **YAML** for configuration management

## Current Status

The system is fully functional with:
- End-to-end email processing pipeline
-  Multi-provider architecture (Gmail, OpenAI, storage options)
-  Comprehensive classification system
-  Document library management
-  Thread-aware conversation handling
-  Production-ready logging and monitoring

**Testing Coverage**
- Mock providers for development and testing
- Standalone module testing capabilities
- Configuration validation and error handling

- Security enhancements for sensitive industries

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. **Email Threading**: Implemented robust conversation tracking using Gmail thread IDs
2. **Provider Abstraction**: Created flexible architecture supporting multiple email/AI providers
3. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient batch processing and caching mechanisms
4. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive retry logic and graceful degradation
5. **Configuration Management**: Secure handling of credentials and flexible deployment options

## Impact and Applications

This email automation system demonstrates practical applications in:
